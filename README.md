#   Monetization

Partner with wine companions/wine regions to promote their wines over others. Give wine producers and wine growers the ability to enter their own information, with an incentive to do so, i.e. set amount of advertising time in exchange. 

Premium version would be for sommelier students or bulk buy of the app for all the employees in a restaurant. Free version would be limited to common wines and promoted wines.
